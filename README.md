This project consists of a few ideas:

-A user must be able to see the inventory of a store
-The inventory is read in by a CSV file
-The user must be able to select how they want to view the products in the inventory
-The user has the option to see the list sorted, by name, category or price
-The user gets a random amount of money put into their wallet
-The user can select to see how much money they can spend
-The user can decide to add or remove items to their cart
-If the user does not have enough money in their wallet to buy the items, they will get a message warning them and the will 
  not be able to purchase those items that exceed their wallet amount
